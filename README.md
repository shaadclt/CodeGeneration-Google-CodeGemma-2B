# Code Generation using Google's CodeGemma-2B LLM Model
This repository demonstrates the potential of using Google's CodeGemma-2B Large Language Model (LLM) to assist in generating code.

## Disclaimer:

- The generated code by the LLM is meant for demonstration purposes and might require refinement for optimal functionality and security.
- It's crucial to understand and implement proper error handling and input validation when deploying in production.

## Conclusion
This example showcases the potential of LLMs to assist in code generation. However, it requires careful review and adaptation to ensure code quality and security.
